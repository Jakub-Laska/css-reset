# My CSS Reset:

This is a simple CSS reset that I created to ensure consistent styling across all my projects. It provides a clean slate by removing browser inconsistencies and standardizing basic styles such as margins, padding, and fonts. This reset will allow me to build projects without worrying about unexpected default styles.

## Features

- Cross-Browser Consistency: This reset neutralizes browser-specific defaults, ensuring your project looks the same across all browsers.
- Smooth Transitions: Adds smooth transitions to elements for better responsiveness.
- Button and Link Styling: Removes default button and link styles and makes sure links and buttons are styled consistently.
- Universal Box-Sizing: Ensures consistent box-sizing for all elements.
- Simple and Customizable: I designed this reset to be flexible and easy to modify for any project.

# Emmet Snippet Integration

I’ve also incorporated an Emmet snippet that lets me quickly generate an HTML boilerplate with the reset and necessary linked files (CSS, JS) using the shortcut '1' followed by Tab. This snippet will automatically link the reset CSS in the project, saving me time and effort while starting new projects.

Integrating the Emmet Snippet:

1. Open the Command Palette:
   On Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + P
   On Mac: Cmd + Shift + P

2. Search for and select:
   Preferences: Configure User Snippets

3. Choose:
   html.json (from the list of snippet files – this will be for HTML-specific snippets)

4. Paste your snippet:
   Copy the content of the html.json file from this repository and paste it into your html.json file.

### Now, you can use the 1 shortcut and press Tab in any HTML file to generate the boilerplate with the reset CSS linked automatically.

# Files Included

- reset.css: The CSS reset file that normalizes styles across browsers.
- Snippet for Emmet: An Emmet snippet that links the reset and JavaScript files in new projects automatically.
